Colors
 ---------
Bootstrap 4 has some contextual classes
 .primary           (blue)
.success             (green)
.info                   (light-blue)
.warning           (orange)
.danger             (red)
.secondary        (gray)
.dark                 (dark-gray)
.light                 (light-gray)
.white                (white)

->if you want text to colored...then we can use like these below
 syntax : text-{one of contextual classes}
 
ex :text-primary

->Contextual text classes can also be used on links like ...
eg :<a href="#" class="text-danger">Danger link.</a>


->if you want background to colored...then we can use like these below
  syntax :bg-{one of contextual classes}

eg :bg-secondary
